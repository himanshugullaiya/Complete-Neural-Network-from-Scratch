# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
I have developed a Keras like Neural Network from scratch. 
Just import the module named "self-made-network" and use it. I have demonstrated it's use in the 'testing_neural_network.py' file while comparing the results on a Churn Modelling Dataset of Keras and the self-made-net. I achieved a whopping Accuracy of 82% on the self-made-net.

Optimizations to this net are welcome like kernel and bais regularization etc.
